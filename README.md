## 🧠 What the Project Does

Users can:
- Enter a career goal (e.g. Full Stack Developer, Data Analyst)
- Provide current skills
- Specify a time frame (in months)

The AI agent then generates:
- A structured monthly learning roadmap
- Recommended focus areas
- Actionable next steps

This solves the real problem of **confusion and lack of direction in career planning**.
